*Project Abstract*

The main purpose of this report is to design an algorithm that identifies, replicates, and prevents an attack to a system 
using the Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) approach.  This will help us expand our base cases in identifying threats through 
the means of other proposed solutions of an existing problem. Using our base-case, we will then try to implement an 
algorithm to detect and prevent future attacks that is similar to the initial base-case. In the initial base case, we 
will be looking at how an attacker can effectively gain root access control over a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server 
using an exploit in the “Wu-FTP daemon”. To identify the attack in the initial base case, various logging techniques will 
be used. Some of the programs used for the proposed initial base case includes Snort and TCPFlow. The tools that we will 
be implementing are Snort.
